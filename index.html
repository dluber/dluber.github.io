                            <h1>Leash</h1>
                            <p>Leash is a self-induced solo project for my own development as a product designer. I am particularly interested in mobile applications with complex, back end business demands. A dog walking app is just this - the user must be able to outsource the task with as much ease as requesting an Uber or Lyft - but is for the most part blind to the execution of service.  I focused on the primary interactions a user would have within the mobile app and sought to improve the experience from a number of different angles. See my process below.

                                    <h4>Request Walk</h4>

<p>With the REQUEST WALK function,  you can see me initially play with MAP vs. NO-MAP variations. After many sketches, I concluded that the required screen real estate to house a map was not worth the compromised UX. Thus, I pursued a no-map variation (on hover.)  In this concept, the user’s dogs, walk types, and pickup address are created and programmed in Account Setup. Here, you see DOGS and WALK TYPE formatted in a segmented control interaction, with ADDRESS autofilled. The NOW/LATER toggle would trigger the iOs calendar ticker. Upon submitting this information, the system is able to determine available walkers for that time period. This is another reason to not incorporate a map in REQUEST WALK — it requires this data first to then accurately visualize the available walkers.  I can 100% understand aesthetic arguments for including a map - and am working on that variation as we speak. </p>   
                                </div>

                                    <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/leash/sketches/choosewalker2.jpg" alt="">
<p>From the start, I understood that the CHOOSE WALKER section would require two screens - BROWSE WALKER and WALKER BIO.  For the BROWSE WALKER section, I played with a list view (see middle highlight) and a swipe interaction (similar to what you find in TaskRabbit.) I found the swipe experience to be more mobile-friendly. The order of presented walkers is determined by an algorithm that factors in the walker’s distance away/ETA from the pickup address with his/her ratings. While the user can swipe left and right - upon tap, the user  is submerged into WALKER BIO - where he/she can watch a video of the walker, read reviews, and ultimately BOOK WALKER for the specified Date/Time/Address.</p>                               
                                </div>

<p>In TRACK PROGRESS, the user is able to see a map of the area (left highlight.) From here, the user can follow the route of the walk, while also keeping tabs on the walker’s progress, completing tasks for the specified walk type. At the top of the screen, the user is able to switch to a CHAT FUNCTION (middle highlight) - where he/she can communicate directly to the walker. This is where the walker, too, could send pictures of the dog during the walk. </p>

                            <p class="item-intro text-muted">Developing a heart-focused wearable technology</p>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/pulseband/mockup.jpg" alt"">
                            <p>
To simulate a start-to-finish product development cycle, we at DESIGNATION developed a mock product, the Pulseband. The Pulseband is a wearable technology that measures users’ blood pressure, heart rate, steps, sleep patterns among other vitals. The purpose of this project was to define the scope of the the Pulseband’s capabilities and develop a mobile app alongside those functionalities. Over the course of the project, we implemented various product development methodologies such as <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Scrum_(software_development)" target="_blank">scrum</a> and the <a href="http://www.gv.com/sprint/" target="_blank">Google 5-Day Sprint</a>.<br><br>

As leader of the UX effort, I conducted a robust discovery phase to gain industry insight, understand product line potential, and identify key areas of focus for user research. I interviewed potential users of the Pulseband and subject matter experts (SMEs) in the medical and cardiac-related fields. I synthesized my findings by producing deliverables that could be used by other members of my team. On the IxD side, I helped developed wireframes and prototypes, conduct user testing, and iterate on our designs based on user feedback.                 
                            </p>

With such a medically focused product, Step 1 was familiarizing myself with the vocabulary and landscape of heart disease, cardiac biometrics, and heart-monitoring devices. What biometrics need to be consistently monitored for those with cardiac disease? Which numbers are predictors of an imminent emergency? Do those metrics fall within the scope of the Pulseband’s technological capabilities?<br><br>

Next, I interviewed subject matter experts and potential users to hear both sides of the story. To the medical experts: What are the challenges you face treating heart disease patients? And to those with heart disease: What are your frustrations with the current heart-monitoring/heart-health solutions?<br><br>                                    
                                </p>

                            <p>
Competitive analysis spread across a range of industries, technologies, and brand types. Fuelband, Holter, AliveCor, Jawbone, etc. - What metrics are each of the competitors tracking? Where is there opportunity for Pulseband to differentiate itself? How does that shift who the target consumer is for Pulseband? And how do we build a product accordingly?<br><br>

With this research gathered, the next step was to synthesize. Sketch, draw, storyboard, information architecture, application maps - how do we present all we’ve learned in the best way possible for product development....<br><br>
                            </p>

                            <p>
These user personas are realistic representations of key audience segments for your the Pulseband. The goal of these personas was not to represent every possible audience member but rather to address the major needs of the most important user groups. Through the synthesis of my research, I found that these characters (with these goals and stories) most accurately depict those who are potential Pulseband users.

From our research, we found that any increase in physical activity will result in improved heart health. We let this finding dictate much of our beginning ideation, fueling ideas that would inspire exercise and prompt concern for health. Pictured above is the web app wireframe I created for our original idea — a life coach/trainer in which users would log in on desktop, customize cards from an all-encompassing list of categories, and then receive notifications/reminders on their smartphones and Pulseband at the appropriate, specified times.<br><br>

After user testing, it became clear that this idea was too robust. While users appreciate the ability to customize everything from medicine reminders to exercise encouragement, they were overwhelmed by the immensity of such a platform.
                                </p>

                                <p>
 At that point, we as a group decided to pivot to a goal center model, in which users would automatically be opted into challenges and not have to worry about choosing and customizing each component to their liking.<br><br>

Pictured above are sketches of wireframes I produced. Pictured below is an application map that outlines the application direction. From here, the wireframes were handed off to my IxD and UI teammates.<br><br>

<li><h3>CHALLENGE</h3><p>The business’ ideal (most profitable) order is a dozen units - that is potentially 12 separate customizations for the customer to have to endure.</p></li>

<li><h3>SOLUTION</h3><p>An order ticket that presents 2 choices: Front: “Choose From Our Favorites” or Back: “Create Your Own.”</p></li>

With this solution, the shift manager assigns each employee to a specific job title. Each job title correlates to an area of the store and an accompanying checklist of tasks to be completed within that area. Each employee is solely responsible for his/her checklists and area. Area coverage & checklist depth is calibrated according to traffic --- i.e. the slower the traffic, the job titles to own, areas to cover, and checklists to complete.

                            <p>PURSUITS is a startup based in Chicago currently in <a href="https://beta.pursuits.co/" target="_blank">beta version</a>.

The web application follows a similar interaction to that of <a href="https://trello.com/" target="_blank">Trello</a> in which the user clicks and drags customizable cards between categories/columns.<br><br>

                            Pursuits came to us for UI, branding, and website design help. With a focus on simplicity and ease of use, we got after the UI and IxD efforts.

                            After my teammates and I presented, Pursuits directed us to focus in on the orange and green colors. Pictured below is the interface I created.
